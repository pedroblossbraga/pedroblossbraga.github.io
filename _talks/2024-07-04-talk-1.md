This presentation occurred for the "Convex Optimization for Dynamical Systems" master's seminar at Frierich-Alexander Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg.

## Abstract: 
Region of Attraction (ROA) estimation problems yield interesting optimization approaches when considering polynomial dynamics. In this study, a method presented in [2] is shown, providing an outer approximation to the ROA, solving a Polynomial Optimization problem, induced by occupation measures, approximating an initial infinite dimensional problem with a hierarchy of finite dimensional linear matrix inequalities, with convergence for an arbitrarily large polynomial degree.
