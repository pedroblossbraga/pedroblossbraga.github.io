Biography
======
I'm pursuing an M.Sc. in Computational and Applied Mathematics at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität (FAU) Erlangen-Nürnberg, specializing in Optimization and Numerical Analysis. My thesis will explore optimal cooling, leveraging optimization methods for PDEs, Semi-definite Programs (SDPs), and finite element discretization, including proving convergence of lower bounds.
I hold a B.Sc. in Applied and Computational Mathematics from the University of São Paulo, which included a minor in Statistical Economics; a thesis on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) from an optimization perspective, including kernel methods and Python implementation, with full remarks; and guided studies on Image Classification methods and the Brouwer Topological Degree.
Additionally, I have over five years of professional experience as a data scientist, applying advanced machine learning techniques across various domains, including finance and healthcare. 

Interests
======
My areas of interest include PDEs, nonlinear optimization, dynamical systems, and the intersection of AI and applied mathematics.
