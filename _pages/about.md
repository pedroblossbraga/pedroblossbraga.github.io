I am a PhD student at the chair for Dynamics, Control, Machine Learning and Numerics at FAU Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, under the supervision of Prof. Hannes Meinlschmidt. The PhD topic is Optimal Control for Renormalized Solutions of Evolution Equations.

Previously, I did my master’s in Computational and Applied Mathematics at FAU, with the thesis entitled “FEM Convergence Analysis for Lower Bound Problems in Optimal Cooling”, supervised by Prof. Giovanni Fantuzzi, involving a Gamma-convergence analysis of FE discretizations of the lower bound constrained variational problem. Also, I did my Bachelor’s in Applied Mathematics at the University of São Paulo (USP) in Brazil, with a minor in Statistical Economics (Econometrics).

Additionally, I have some years of professional experience as a data scientist, applying advanced machine learning (ML) techniques across various domains, including finance and healthcare. This involved implementing probabilistic ML models for various applications. 

Interests
